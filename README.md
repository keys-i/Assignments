# eRepo Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for eRepo, an online repository of resources. This repository serves as a central hub for various materials, including assignments, projects, and more. Here you'll find details on how to set up, build, and deploy the repository's resources and documentation.

## Overview

eRepo uses MkDocs to generate a clean, static site for organizing and displaying resources. MkDocs is a straightforward, project-focused documentation generator.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before diving into eRepo:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org/#installation) (can be installed via pip)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/keys-i/eRepo.git
   cd eRepo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Building the Resources

To build the resources and documentation locally:

1. **Run the MkDocs build command:**

   ```bash
   mkdocs build
   ```

   This will generate the static site files in the `site` directory.

2. **Preview the documentation locally:**

   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```

   View the site at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` for a live preview.

## Deployment

eRepo is set up for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages. Each time a change is pushed to the `main` branch, the repositoryâ€™s GitHub Actions workflow handles the deployment process.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow includes steps for:

- Checking out the repository.
- Setting up Python.
- Installing the required dependencies.
- Building the MkDocs site.
- Deploying the static site to GitHub Pages.
